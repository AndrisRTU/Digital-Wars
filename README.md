# Digital-Wars
This game was created as a result of the university's course "The Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence" task.
The AI algorithm includes itself alpha-beta pruning and three heuristic functions: <br />
() one that calculates the difference between each player score, <br />
() the second one that checks if the game can be ended in the current turn for AI, <br />
() and third one which checks if the player will have move to end the game. Respectively in that case AI won't choose the cell where player has move to end the game. <br />
The AI implementation you can find in IngameAI files.
